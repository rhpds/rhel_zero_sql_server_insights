== Remediating the reported Insight

The reported Insight for mssql-server service had a suggested resolution
of changing ownership or group of the Microsoft SQL Server directory
*/var/opt/mssql* from root to mssql.

First, verify the user and group for */var/opt/mssql*:

....
stat -c "%U %G" /var/opt/mssql
....

[source,bash]
----
root root
----

Next, you will change the user and group ownership of */var/opt/mssql*
from root to mssql.

....
chown -R mssql:mssql /var/opt/mssql
....

Verify that the user and group ownership is now updated:

....
stat -c "%U %G" /var/opt/mssql
....

[source,bash]
----
mssql mssql
----

Now that the ownership of the mssql-server directory is updated, restart
the SQL Server service.

....
systemctl restart mssql-server.service
....

Force a Red Hat Insights check-in so that a new batch of system data is
uploaded to the Insights service.

....
insights-client
....
