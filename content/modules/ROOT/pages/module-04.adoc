There are several recommendations offered for this system. Scroll down
through the list until you reach the one entitled _The mssql-server
service will fail to start when the ownership or group of Microsoft SQL
Server directory /var/opt/mssql is not correct_

From the _Detected issues_ section of the recommendation, you can see
that this Insight is being triggered by the machine running Microsoft
SQL Server with incorrect ownership or group of /var/opt/mssql.

In the _Steps to resolve_ section of the recommendation, there is a
command to fix the issue. We will fix this in the next step.
